This bug occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with a large dataset.  The issue is that the `renderItem` function is called repeatedly for the same item, leading to performance issues and incorrect rendering. This is often not immediately obvious, as it may only appear under specific conditions or with certain data structures. The problem stems from improper key management within the `FlatList` or incorrect data updates, leading to the component re-rendering the same item multiple times.
